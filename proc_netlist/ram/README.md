# RAM


## Description

Uses only 3 inputs, the first input is used as the read address or a write data depending on the instruction,
the second decides if we should write in the RAM or not and the last one is the write address.

All addresses are on 16 bits (so the netlist can be simulated in a decent amount of time).
