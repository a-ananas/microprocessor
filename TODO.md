# What to do

## REPORT

- [ ] Correct report (instruction number / format)
- [ ] Add huge schema of the entire microproc archithecture using small blocks + links to readme for every blocks


## PROCESSOR

- [x] create atomic blocks (carotte functions, cf carotte/tutorials) that we'll probably use later

- [x] desgin the ALU (on paper)

- [x] implement the ALU (as a huge block using carotte)

- [ ] reproduce the proc made in class

- ... probably few steps missing here

- [ ] design the full microproc


## SIMULATOR

- [x] pick one of our simulator and add it to the repo

## GLOBAL

- [ ] Make the assembly clock
