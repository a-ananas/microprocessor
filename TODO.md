# What to do

## REPORT

- [x] Correct report (instruction number / format)
- [ ] Add huge schema of the entire microproc archithecture using small blocks + links to readme for every blocks

---

## PROCESSOR

- [x] Create atomic blocks (carotte functions, cf carotte/tutorials) that we'll probably use later

- [x] Desgin the ALU (on paper)

- [x] Implement the ALU (as a huge block using carotte)

- [x] Reproduce the proc made in class

- [x] Design the full microproc

- [x] Implement instruction decoder

---

## SIMULATOR

- [x] Pick one of our simulator and add it to the repo

- [x] Split the ROM into blocks of byte

- [ ] Split the RAM into blocks of byte

---

## GLOBAL

- [x] Make the assembly clock

- [x] Make the double dabble logic
