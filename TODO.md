# What to do

## REPORT

- don't know what to add ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


## PROCESSOR

- [ ] create atomic blocks (carotte functions, cf carotte/tutorials) that we'll probably use later

- [ ] desgin the ALU (on paper)

- [ ] implement the ALU (as a huge block using carotte)

- [ ] reproduce the proc made in class

- ... probably few steps missing here

- [ ] design the full microproc


## SIMULATOR

- [ ] pick one of our simulator and add it to the repo
